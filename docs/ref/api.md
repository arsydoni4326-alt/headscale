# API

Headscale provides a [HTTP REST API](#rest-api) which may be used to integrate a [web
interface](integration/web-ui.md), [remote control Headscale](#remote-control) or provide a base for custom
integration and tooling.

The API requires a valid API key before use. To create an API key, log into your Headscale server and generate
one with the default expiration of 90 days:

```shell
headscale apikeys create
```

Copy the output of the command and save it for later. Please note that you can not retrieve an API key again. If the API
key is lost, expire the old one, and create a new one.

To list the API keys currently associated with the server:

```shell
headscale apikeys list
```

and to expire an API key:

```shell
headscale apikeys expire --prefix <PREFIX>
```

## REST API

- API endpoint: `/api/v1`, e.g. `https://headscale.example.com/api/v1`
- Documentation: `/api/v1/docs`, e.g. `https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/docs`
- Headscale Version: `/version`, e.g. `https://headscale.example.com/version`
- Authenticate using HTTP Bearer authentication by sending the [API key](#api) with the HTTP `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header.

Start by [creating an API key](#api) and test it with the examples below. Read the API documentation provided by your
Headscale server at `/api/v1/docs` for details.

=== "Get details for all users"

    ```console
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
        https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/user
    ```

=== "Get details for user 'bob'"

    ```console
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
        https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/user?name=bob
    ```

=== "Register a node"

    ```console
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
        --json '{"user": "<USER>", "authId": "<AUTH_ID>"}' \
        https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/auth/register
    ```

### Machine approval

The fork provides API endpoints for approving pending machines that have initiated
web authentication. Machines awaiting approval can be approved individually or in bulk.

!!! note "Coordinate with backend agent"
    The exact request/response schemas, error codes, and authentication requirements
    need to be confirmed with the backend API agent. Placeholders below represent
    expected behavior based on the task specification.

=== "Approve a single machine"

    Approve a specific machine by its ID.

    **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/machines/{id}/approve`

    **Authentication:** Requires API key with machine management permissions.

    **Path parameters:**

    - `id` (required): Machine ID to approve

    **Request body:** (TBD - confirm with backend agent)

    ```json
    {
      "user": "<USER>"
    }
    ```

    **Response:** (TBD - confirm with backend agent)

    ```json
    {
      "machine": {
        "id": "12345",
        "name": "laptop",
        "user": "alice",
        "approved": true,
        "online": true
      }
    }
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```console
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
      --json '{"user": "alice"}' \
      https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/machines/12345/approve
    ```

=== "Bulk approve machines"

    Approve multiple machines in a single request.

    **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/machines/approve`

    **Authentication:** Requires API key with machine management permissions.

    **Request body:** (TBD - confirm with backend agent)

    ```json
    {
      "machineIds": ["12345", "12346", "12347"],
      "user": "<USER>"
    }
    ```

    **Response:** (TBD - confirm with backend agent)

    ```json
    {
      "approved": ["12345", "12346", "12347"],
      "failed": [],
      "errors": {}
    }
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```console
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
      --json '{"machineIds": ["12345", "12346"], "user": "alice"}' \
      https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/machines/approve
    ```

**Common error responses:** (TBD - confirm with backend agent)

- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request body or missing required fields
- `401 Unauthorized` - Missing or invalid API key
- `403 Forbidden` - Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found` - Machine ID not found
- `409 Conflict` - Machine already approved or in invalid state

See the [registration methods](registration.md#web-authentication) documentation for
the complete web-based approval workflow, including CLI approval with
`headscale auth register`.

### Update check

The fork exposes a public, unauthenticated endpoint that reports the running
binary's version information and, optionally, whether an update is available:

```console
curl https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/update-check
```

Without `?check=true`, the endpoint returns the current version information
only. With `?check=true`, it fetches the latest release tag (for release
builds) or commit hash (for dev builds) from the configured GitHub repository
and compares it with the running binary:

```console
curl "https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/update-check?check=true"
```

Results are cached for 15 minutes. The remote repository can be overridden via
the `HEADSCALE_UPDATE_CHECK_REPO` environment variable.

See [The fork](../about/fork.md) for details about this fork-specific feature.

### DERP map

The fork exposes a read-only, authenticated endpoint that returns the current
DERP relay map configuration:

```console
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/derp
```

The response reports whether DERP is configured, the total region count, and
each region's ID, name, code, and relay nodes (name, hostname, DERP/STUN
ports, IPv4/IPv6). This powers the DERP status page in Headplane.

### Machine approval

Machines that have not yet been approved cannot join the tailnet. Two
authenticated endpoints approve pending machines (see
[Registration](./registration.md) for how a machine ends up pending):

=== "Approve one machine"

    ```console
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
        --json '{"nodeId": "123"}' \
        https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/machines/123/approve
    ```

    The response is `{"success": true, "node": {...}}`, with the approved
    machine's full record.

=== "Approve several machines"

    ```console
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
        --json '{"nodeIds": ["123", "456"]}' \
        https://headscale.example.com/api/v1/machines/approve
    ```

    The response reports the outcome per node:
    `{"success": true, "approved": ["123"], "failed": ["456"], "errors": {"456": "machine not found: 456"}, "results": [...]}`.
    `success` is true when at least one machine was approved; the batch is not
    atomic, so a failure for one machine does not affect the others.

Both endpoints require write access to machines: an admin API key (all-access)
or an OAuth access token holding the `devices:core` scope. A read-only token is
rejected with `403`. Approving a machine clears its key expiry so it no longer
reports as expired, and records an audit log entry (action `machine_approve` or
`machine_approve_bulk`).

## Join nodes with an OAuth client

Headscale also serves a subset of the Tailscale-compatible API at `/api/v2`, which
accepts **OAuth 2.0 client-credentials** in addition to API keys. The Tailscale
client can use an OAuth client secret in place of an auth key: it exchanges the
secret for an access token, mints a single-use tagged auth key and registers with
it. This works anywhere the client takes an auth key: `tailscale up`, the
container image, `tsnet` and the
[`tailscale/github-action`](https://github.com/tailscale/github-action). One
long-lived secret joins any number of nodes.

Create an OAuth client with the `auth_keys` scope and the tags its nodes get. The
secret is shown once:

```shell
headscale oauth-clients create --scope auth_keys --tag tag:ci
```

Build the auth key from the secret:

1. Swap the prefix: `hskey-client-…` becomes `tskey-client-…`. The client only
   runs the exchange for `tskey-client-`; Headscale accepts both.
1. Append `?baseURL=<your Headscale URL>`.
1. Set `--advertise-tags`. Each tag must exist in the policy's `tagOwners` and be
   one of the OAuth client's tags, or owned by one of them.

```text
tskey-client-<id>-<secret>?baseURL=https://headscale.example.com
```

!!! warning

    Without `baseURL` the client sends the secret to `https://api.tailscale.com`.

### Attributes

These are all the attributes the client understands; any other is an error.
Order does not matter and an empty value means the default.

| Attribute       | Default                     | Effect                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `baseURL`       | `https://api.tailscale.com` | Where the exchange and key creation go. Your Headscale URL, no trailing slash.                   |
| `ephemeral`     | `true`                      | Node is removed after it goes offline (`node.ephemeral.inactivity_timeout`). `false` to keep it. |
| `preauthorized` | `false`                     | Accepted, no effect: Headscale always authorizes pre-auth-key nodes.                             |

Booleans take any Go `strconv.ParseBool` value (`true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, …).

### Examples

`tailscale up`, either as the auth key or via `--client-secret` (which also takes
`file:/path/to/secret`):

```shell
tailscale up --login-server https://headscale.example.com --advertise-tags tag:ci \
  --auth-key 'tskey-client-<id>-<secret>?baseURL=https://headscale.example.com&ephemeral=false'
```

Container image:

```shell
docker run -d --name tailscale \
  -e TS_AUTHKEY='tskey-client-<id>-<secret>?baseURL=https://headscale.example.com' \
  -e TS_EXTRA_ARGS='--login-server=https://headscale.example.com --advertise-tags=tag:ci' \
  tailscale/tailscale
```

`tsnet` (`TS_CLIENT_SECRET` works too); import `tailscale.com/feature/oauthkey`:

```go
srv := &tsnet.Server{
    ControlURL:    "https://headscale.example.com",
    AuthKey:       "tskey-client-<id>-<secret>?baseURL=https://headscale.example.com",
    AdvertiseTags: []string{"tag:ci"},
}
```

GitHub Action, with the whole string stored as a repository secret:

{% raw %}

```yaml
- uses: tailscale/github-action@v4
  with:
    authkey: ${{ secrets.HEADSCALE_AUTHKEY }}
    args: --login-server=https://headscale.example.com --advertise-tags=tag:ci
```

{% endraw %}

Use `authkey` even though upstream marks it deprecated: `oauth-secret` appends its
own `?…` to the secret, which corrupts `baseURL`.

## Remote control

The `headscale` binary can control a Headscale instance from a remote machine over the HTTP API.

### Prerequisite

- A workstation to run `headscale` (any supported platform, e.g. Linux).
- The Headscale server reachable over HTTP(S).
- An [API key](#api) to authenticate with the Headscale server.

### Setup remote control

1. Download the [`headscale` binary from GitHub's release page](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/releases). Make
   sure to use the same version as on the server.

1. Put the binary somewhere in your `PATH`, e.g. `/usr/local/bin/headscale`

1. Make `headscale` executable: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/headscale`

1. [Create an API key](#api) on the Headscale server.

1. Provide the connection parameters for the remote Headscale server either via a minimal YAML configuration file or
   via environment variables:

    === "Minimal YAML configuration file"

        ```yaml title="config.yaml"
        cli:
            address: <HEADSCALE_URL>
            api_key: <API_KEY>
        ```

    === "Environment variables"

        ```shell
        export HEADSCALE_CLI_ADDRESS="<HEADSCALE_URL>"
        export HEADSCALE_CLI_API_KEY="<API_KEY>"
        ```

    This instructs the `headscale` binary to connect to a remote instance at `<HEADSCALE_URL>` (e.g.
    `https://headscale.example.com`), instead of connecting to the local instance. A bare host without a scheme is
    assumed to be `https`.

1. Test the connection by listing all nodes:

    ```shell
    headscale nodes list
    ```

    You should now be able to see a list of your nodes from your workstation, and you can
    now control the Headscale server from your workstation.

### Behind a proxy

The remote CLI uses the same HTTP API as everything else, so it works through the reverse proxy already in front of
Headscale with no extra setup.

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have the _same_ Headscale version on your server and workstation.
- Verify that your TLS certificate is valid and trusted.
- If you don't have access to a trusted certificate (e.g. from Let's Encrypt), either:
    - Add your self-signed certificate to the trust store of your OS _or_
    - Disable certificate verification by either setting `cli.insecure: true` in the configuration file or by setting
      `HEADSCALE_CLI_INSECURE=1` via an environment variable. We do **not** recommend to disable certificate validation.
